ðŸ“–# What this project is about?

This project is being built with the intention to implement a generic web application using Material Angular.<br>
I don't have much idea of what this project will turn out, but my intention is to apply my studies of Angular in a practical project.<br>
Any suggestions, tips and support is allways welcome! Thx!<br>
